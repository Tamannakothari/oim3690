# What I learnt today

1. # View source
We can see the source code of any website by typing view-source: before the website URL. I tried this on around 15 different websites, including my family business website and LinkedIn.

2. # Meta
What meta means, why it is used in coding and how meta tags are used to show a website’s description.

3. # Websites vs web apps
The difference between websites and web apps. Some platforms we think of as websites are actually web apps because they allow users to interact with them.

4. # Temporary changes to website
How we can make temporary changes to a website on our end by going to Menu -> More Tools -> Developer Tools -> Elements, understand how different parts of a webpage are structured.
